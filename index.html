The car I bought was in great shape, and the price was excellent - truly living up to their \"low cost\" name. If you're in the market for a quality used car at a great price, I highly recommend giving Low Cost Auto Body a visit. They've earned my trust and future business."

        "body": "My son recently lost his car in an accident where he was hit while stopped at a red light by a distracted driver. The insurance gave us some money to replace the vehicle and we wanted to find something affordable and safe. We looked at dealerships, Facebook, and KSL and that is how we found Rony at Low Cost Auto. The car we found for my son was a 2019 Honda with all of the modern safety features. The car looks great and drives great. It had only 50 thousand miles on it, and is in mechanically perfect condition. This was easily the best car at the most affordable price we could find in weeks of looking. My son loves it. Low Cost Auto sells a small number of cars, and is also a full service body shop. They purchase totaled cars with cosmetic damage only and fix them in their own shop and then resell them at an affordable price. Most people who are looking for used cars want to avoid damaged cars because they think they won't work well. Low Cost Auto have been doing this for a long time and they won't buy any cars with mechanical or any safety concerns. Cars can be totaled for being sideswiped or rear ended, or minor front bumper damage that sets off an airbag even if it is a low mileage vehicle with nothing mechanically wrong with it at all. Rony will show you pictures of the car with the damage before they fixed it, he will be completely transparent about what they did and didn't fix, and if you have any problems within the first month of owning the car, they will fix it, no questions asked, even if it had nothing to do with the damage they repaired. They care about their customers and want them to be happy. One other great thing about doing business with this family, is there is no haggling or getting ripped off with extras or hidden fees. You can look at the price they are listing the car for, add on the state required taxes, and that is exactly what you will pay. Not one penny more. No doc fees, prep fees, bonus fees, NOTHING. I am buying my next car from them because I appreciate how they treat their customers."
